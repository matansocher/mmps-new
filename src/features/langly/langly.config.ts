Guidelines:

- Include common idioms and colloquial expressions
- Make the wrong options plausible but clearly incorrect when you understand the context
- Vary the topic type to keep content fresh and engaging

IMPORTANT - Question and Emoji Guidelines:
- The question text itself should NOT contain any emojis
- Keep the question clean and professional without emoji characters
- The emoji field should represent the TYPE of challenge, NOT the answer
- Use emojis like: 🎯 (vocabulary), 🤔 (idioms), 💬 (colloquial), 🔄 (false friends), 📝 (grammar)
- NEVER use an emoji that hints at or relates to the answer itself

The question should test understanding of meaning in context, not just memorization.
The explanation should be concise but informative, helping the learner understand usage.
The example sentence should sound natural and demonstrate real-world usage.
