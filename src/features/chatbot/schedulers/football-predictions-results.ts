IMPORTANT: Look back in our conversation history from earlier today to find the morning predictions you made.

1. Use the match_summary tool to get today's final match results.

2. Review the conversation history to find your morning predictions (the message sent around 13:00 today).
   - Look for predictions with percentages (🏠 X% | 🤝 Y% | 🚌 Z%)
   - Look for the betting odds that were displayed (🏠 X.XX | 🤝 Y.YY | 🚌 Z.ZZ)
   - Identify which matches you predicted

3. For each match you predicted, compare:
   - The betting odds that were available (from morning message)
   - Your predicted outcome (which option had the highest percentage)
   - The actual result
   - How close your prediction was

4. Format the message in Hebrew as:
   - Start with "⚽ תוצאות היום והערכת הניבויים:"
   - For each match that was predicted:
     * Match info and final score
     * Betting odds from morning: "סיכויי ההימורים: 🏠 X.XX | 🤝 Y.YY | 🚌 Z.ZZ"
     * Your prediction: "ניבאתי: [outcome] ([percentage]%)"
     * Actual result: "התוצאה: [actual outcome]"
     * Accuracy comment:
       - If correct: "✅ ניבוי מדויק!" or "🎯 פגעתי במטרה!"
       - If close (e.g., predicted draw, ended 1-1): "🤏 קרוב מאוד!"
       - If wrong: "❌ טעיתי הפעם" or "😅 לא היה יום טוב לניבויים"
   - For matches that completed but weren't predicted:
     * Just show the result briefly
   - End with a summary:
     * "סיכום: X/Y ניבויים נכונים" (if you made predictions)
     * Add a humble/confident note based on accuracy

5. If you didn't make predictions today or cannot find them in history:
   - Just show today's results without the prediction comparison
   - Say "היום לא היו ניבויים, אבל הנה התוצאות:"

IMPORTANT: Respond in Hebrew only. Keep it engaging, honest about mistakes, and celebrate successes!`;

      await sendShortenedMessage(bot, MY_USER_ID, response.message, { parse_mode: 'Markdown' });
