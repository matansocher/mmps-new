## Getting Started
To run this application, ensure you have Node.js 20.x installed. Each bot operates independently and interacts with Telegram using the `node-telegram-bot-api` library.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matansocher/mmps
   cd mmps
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
3. Set up environment variables
   Create a .env file in the root directory and define the required environment variables:
   ```bash
   IS_PROD=false
    
   OPENAI_API_KEY=

   MONGO_DB_URL=
   
   LOCAL_ACTIVE_BOT_ID=#the id of the bot that you want to run (in BOT_CONFIG of each bot)
   PLAYGROUNDS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=#a bot token to work with
   NOTIFIER_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=#another bot token to work with
   ```

## Architecture

This application uses a **plain TypeScript architecture** with manual dependency injection:

### Key Features
- **No framework overhead** - Direct TypeScript/Node.js application
- **Manual dependency injection** - Each feature has an `init()` function that sets up services, controllers, and schedulers
- **node-cron for scheduling** - Periodic tasks use `node-cron` with timezone support
- **MongoDB** - Native MongoDB driver for data persistence
- **AI Integration** - LangChain, Anthropic, and OpenAI for AI-powered features

### Conditional Bot Loading
The application supports running individual bots in development or all bots in production:

```typescript
// Set LOCAL_ACTIVE_BOT_ID to run a specific bot
LOCAL_ACTIVE_BOT_ID=chatbot npm run start:dev

// Or run all bots (production mode)
IS_PROD=true npm start
```
